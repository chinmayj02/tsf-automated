## What is Testing? 

Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. The benefits of testing include preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance.

## Selenium

Selenium is an open source umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries aimed at supporting browser automation. It provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests across most modern web browsers, without the need to learn a test scripting language.

## Selenium WebDriver

Selenium WebDriver is **a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests**. This tool is used for automating web-based application testing to verify that it performs expectedly. Selenium WebDriver allows you to choose any programming language to create test scripts.
